# BXEngine (Backrooms Explorer Engine)

This is a point-and-click adventure game engine being designed for the planned Backrooms Explorer game. Games for this engine are written entirely in simple and predefined JSON formats, with optional Python scripting for more complex game events.

The current test world uses unlicensed assets for testing purposes only.
